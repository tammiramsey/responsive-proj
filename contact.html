    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer and educator from Lodi, United State of America</h3>

    <div class="about">
        <p>
            I am a developing developer, who is both teaching computer science concepts,
            while at the same time continuing to push myself to learn more about this new field
            I have found myself in.
            <br>
            <br>
            My coding strengths lie in Web Development (HTML, CSS) and JavaScript.
            I have recently started learning C# alongside my students in our Game Development
            with Unity course.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a historian by training, and nerd at heart. I enjoy learning different aspects of
            the world of computer science, and facilitating the learning of my students to find
            their own niche within the world of computer science.
            <br>
            <br>
            More than anything, I belive that anyone can learn to code, and find ways to take computational
            thinking and apply it to any part of their lives. It brings me joy to facilitate that discovery.
